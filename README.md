change_soup_content
===================

Small Javascripts that change content on soup.io

How to:
===

go to your soup,
or register a soup account, its a really nice company that only complies to austrian law.
no nsa shit ;)
on the other hand all content is public so this may just be a useless marketing speech.
but seriously, (try it)[http://soup.io]

once logged in:

go into page edit mode.

paste the following javascript to the description  textarea (html id of wrapper element = admin-descriptionWidgIframe):

to change another text then the two already changed in the script just find out the href of the link and either add an else if clause or replace the if as you wish :)
forking the script might be your best choice then.

the scripts will only work on your own soup,
but it will work for everyone visiting it as well ;)

(this also is how the pirateship on @jascha works, the source for the ship is on github: https://github.com/jaeh/arr ;) )
