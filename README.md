Stirring the Soup
===

Small Javascripts that change content on [soup.io](http://soup.io)

What is it?
=====

[menu.js](https://github.com/jaeh/change_soup_content/blob/master/menu.js)
======
Change the Soup My Friends and Friends Of Friends Menu text to My Mates and Mates of mates


[arr.js](https://github.com/jaeh/change_soup_content/blob/master/arr.js)
======
i use this script on [my soup](http://jascha.soup.io)



How to:
=====

go to your soup,
or register a [soup](http://soup.io) account

once logged in:

go into page edit mode.

paste either the arr.js or the menu.js javascript to the description textarea (html id of wrapper element = admin-descriptionWidgIframe) [or both if you wanna go wild]

to change another text then the two already changed in the script just find out the href of the link and either add an else if clause or replace the if as you wish :)

forking the script might be your best choice then.

you can also create an issue and if there are more than some i might be tempted to further work on this,
eg make all text items editable ;)

the scripts will only work on your own soup,
but it will work for everyone visiting it as well ;)

this also is how the pirateship on [@jascha](http://jascha.soup.io) works, the source for the ship and waves is on github as well: [arr](https://github.com/jaeh/arr)
